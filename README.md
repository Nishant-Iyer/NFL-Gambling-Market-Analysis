# Project-1-NFL-Gambling-Market-Analysis
We combine historical NFL game data, stadium coordinates, weather conditions, and advanced metrics to test if models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) can beat bookmaker lines for spreads and over/unders. Our findings indicate highly efficient markets, making consistent profits challenging.
