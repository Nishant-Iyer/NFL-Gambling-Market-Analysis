# Project-1-NFL-Gambling-Market-Analysis
We combine historical NFL game data, stadium coordinates, weather conditions, and advanced metrics to test if models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) can beat bookmaker lines for spreads and over/unders. Our findings indicate highly efficient markets, making consistent profits challenging.

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of NFL games to investigate potential inefficiencies in the gambling market. We explore historical game data, weather information, and advanced team metrics to predict:
- **Point Spread** coverage
- **Over/Under** (Totals)

Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, and `requests`, we build models to see if there is any persistent edge against the bookmakersâ€™ lines.
